# AI Agent Knowledge Base Automation

## Overview
This project is designed to enhance the AI Agent's knowledge base by allowing it to incrementally expand its understanding using self-provided documents. With this enriched knowledge, the AI Agent can automate responses, process information, and send relevant emails based on user interactions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Knowledge Expansion**: The AI Agent can retrieve and process documents from Google Docs to enhance its responses.
- **Telegram Integration**: Users can interact with the AI Agent through Telegram, sending queries and receiving responses.
- **AI-Driven Automation**: The system utilizes OpenAI's Chat Model to generate intelligent responses based on accumulated knowledge.
- **Conditional Logic Processing**: Business logic is implemented through code modules to ensure the correct flow of information.
- **Automated Emailing**: Based on the AI-generated insights, emails can be sent automatically using Gmail.
- **Custom Field Editing**: The workflow includes an "Edit Fields" module to refine and adjust responses before sending them out.

## Workflow
1. **Telegram Trigger**: A message update from Telegram starts the automation.
2. **AI Agent Processing**: The AI Agent analyzes the message and determines if additional knowledge is required.
3. **Google Docs Integration**: If needed, the AI Agent fetches relevant documents to expand its understanding.
4. **OpenAI Model Execution**: The chatbot model generates a response using its updated knowledge base.
5. **Code Processing**: The information is processed through custom code modules for validation and formatting.
6. **Telegram Response**: A reply is sent back to the Telegram user.
7. **Conditional Logic (If Statement)**: Determines if an email should be sent based on predefined conditions.
8. **Email Dispatch**: If conditions are met, an automated email is sent via Gmail.

## Technologies Used
- **Telegram API**: For user interaction and message handling
- **OpenAI API**: For AI-powered chat responses
- **Google Docs API**: For fetching additional knowledge
- **Gmail API**: For automated email dispatch
- **Custom Code Modules**: To handle logic and data processing

## How to Use
1. Connect the AI Agent to Telegram and Google Docs.
2. Provide relevant documents in Google Docs to expand the AI's knowledge.
3. Interact with the AI Agent via Telegram to retrieve intelligent responses.
4. Set up conditions to trigger automated email responses when necessary.

## Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced Document Processing**: Allowing integration with more file formats.
- **More AI Models**: Experimenting with different AI models for better accuracy.
- **User Personalization**: Customizable responses based on user profiles.
- **Logging and Analytics**: Tracking AI interactions and email performance.

This project ensures that the AI Agent can continuously improve and provide automated, knowledge-driven responses effectively.
